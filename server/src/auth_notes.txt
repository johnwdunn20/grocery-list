# Steps to persist multiple sessions
1. Create sessions collections in mongo - add a TTL index to automatically delete old documents 
2. On all auth middleware, check the collection
  a. login & signup : create new document
  b. isLoggedIn: check it
  c. loggedout: delete document

* might need to use express-session package?

*** Google Indexing
